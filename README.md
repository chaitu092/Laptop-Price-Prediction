## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to create end to end machine learning model to predict prices of laptop based on given set of features. If a user who is not aware of  price of laptops, but knows the features by selecting the  desired features and configurations, we can predict the price using our website.

## Steps involved

1. Data Preprocessing and cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Modeling
5. Website/UI
6. Deployment in Cloud platform(Herouku)
